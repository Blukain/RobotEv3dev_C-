# RobotEv3dev_C-
Repo C++ based on Ev3dev

This repository is about how to setup your system on linux for developing on Ev3dev with C++.
This little guide will set you up and running, is based on ev3dev-jessie firmware and its C++ library made by Denis Demidov,
that can be found at https://github.com/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp

I have corrected some problems regarding Ports for motors and Cmake file to let it compile straight from the project with out any problem.
Experiment yourself.
